# ðŸ”¥ Match Strike ðŸ”¥

## What is it?

A Times Tech Guild-themed variant on the classic Memory card game, where playing cards are placed face down in a grid format and then turned over two at a time, seeking matching pairs. Instead of playing cards, we used strike placards. 

## Why did we build it?

The Times Tech Guild is on strike, and we are asking that our supporters boycott all NYT Games as well as NYT Cooking. We are not currently asking for a boycott of NYT News. We made this game so our supporters can play games without crossing the picket digital line.

## Why are you on strike?

The Times Tech Guild---unionized workers who build and maintain election-critical programs and power all the games you love---have been fighting for a first contract for over two years. The company failed to come to an acceptable deal, and we are now on strike over the company's numerous unfair labor practices.

We need your support---[Tell The New York Times you stand with tech workers in our fight for a fair contract!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtdcZ7zzDBS2WTf8dbGQ5hyCOvb0hYCDOPetOwucGJLDQj6w/viewform)
